    <p>
      A small railway station near London. Time: Ten years ago.

    </p>
    <p>
      'Ow goes it, Bill?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Goes it? 'Ow d'yer think it goes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know, Bill. 'Ow is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Bloody.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? What's wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrong? Nothing ain't wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      What's up then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing ain't right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, wot's the worry?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Wot's the worry? They don't give you better wages nor a dog, and then they
      thinks they can talk at yer and talk at yer, and say wot they likes, like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? You been on the carpet, Bill?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Ain't I! Proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, wot about, Bill?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Wot about? I'll tell yer. Just coz I let a lidy get into a train. That's
      wot about. Said I ought to 'av stopped 'er. Thought the train was moving.
      Thought it was dangerous. Thought I tried to murder 'er, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Wot? The other day?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuesday?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Why. The one that dropped her bag?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Drops 'er bag. Writes to the company. They writes back she shouldn't
      'av got in. She writes back she should. Then they gets on to me. Any more
      of it and I'll...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      I wouldn't, Bill; don't you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't you, Bill. You've got your family to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, anyway, I won't let any more of them passengers go jumping into
      trains any more, not when they're moving, I won't. When the train gets in,
      doors shut. That's the rule. And they'll 'ave to abide by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I wouldn't stop one, not if...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't care. They ain't going to 'ave me on the mat again and talk all
      that stuff to me. No, if someone 'as to suffer... 'Ere she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Noise of approaching train heard.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, that's her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      And shut goes the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter JOHN BEAL.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Wait a moment, Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Not if he's... Not if he was ever so.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN [preparing to pass]
    </p>
    <p>
      Good morning....
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Can't come through. Too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Too late? Why, the train's only just in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't care. It's the rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, nonsense. [He carries on.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      It's too late. I tell you you can't come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      But that's absurd. I want to catch my train.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      It's too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Let him go, Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm blowed if I let him go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to catch my train.
    </p>
    <p>
      [JOHN is stopped by BILL and pushed back by the face. JOHN advances
      towards BILL looking like fighting. The train has gone.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Only doing my duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      [JOHN stops and reflects at this, deciding it isn't good enough. He shrugs
      his shoulders, turns round and goes away.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I shouldn't be surprised if I didn't get even with you one of these days,
      you..... and some way you won't expect.

    <p>
      <br /> SCENE 2
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Curtain rises on JOHN and MARY in their suburban home.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I say, dear. Don't you think we ought to plant an acacia?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      An acacia, what's that, John?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, it's one of those trees that they have.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      But why, John?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you see the house is called The Acacias, and it seems rather silly
      not to have at least one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      O, I don't think that matters. Lots of places are called lots of things.
      Everyone does.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, but it might help the postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      O, no, it wouldn't, dear. He wouldn't know an acacia if he saw it any more
      than I should.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite right, Mary, you're always right. What a clever head you've got!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Have I, John? We'll plant an acacia if you like. I'll ask about it at the
      grocer's.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      You can't get one there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      No, but he's sure to know where it can be got.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Where do they grow, Mary?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know, John; but I am sure they do, somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow I wish sometimes, I almost wish I could have gone abroad for a
      week or so to places like where acacias grow naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      O, would you really, John?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not really. But I just think of it sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Where would you have gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, I don't know. The East or some such place. I've often heard people
      speak of it, and somehow it seemed so...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      The East, John? Not the East. I don't think the East somehow is quite
      respectable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O well, it's all right, I never went, and never shall go now. It doesn't
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY [the photographs catching her eye]
    </p>
    <p>
      O, John, I meant to tell you. Such a dreadful thing happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      What, Mary?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Liza was dusting the photographs, and when she came to Jane's she
      says she hadn't really begun to dust it, only looked at it, and it fell
      down, and that bit of glass is broken right out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Ask her not to look at it so hard another time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      O, what do you mean, John?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that's how she broke it; she said so, and as I know you believe in
      Liza...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I can't think she'd tell a lie, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, of course not. But she mustn't look so hard another time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      And it's poor little Jane's photograph. She will feel it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, that's all right, we'll get it mended.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, it's a dreadful thing to have happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll get it mended, and if Jane is unhappy about it she can have Alice's
      frame. Alice is too young to notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      She isn't, John. She'd notice it quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, George, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY [looking at photo thoughtfully]
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, perhaps George might give up his frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, tell Liza to change it. Why not make her do it now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to-day, John. Not on a Sunday. She shall do it to-morrow by the time
      you get back from the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      All right. It might have been worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      It's bad enough. I wish it hadn't happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been worse. It might have been Aunt Martha.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd sooner it had been her than poor little Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      If it had been Aunt Martha's photograph she'd have walked in next day and
      seen it for certain; I know Aunt Martha. Then there'd have been trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      But, John, how could she have known?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know, but she would have; it's a kind of devilish sense she has.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      John!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      What's the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      John! What a dreadful word you used. And on a Sunday too! Really!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, I'm sorry. It slipped out somehow. I'm very sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter LIZA.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a gentleman to see you, sir, which isn't, properly speaking, a
      gentleman at all. Not what I should call one, that is, like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a gentleman! Good gracious, Liza! Whatever do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      He's black.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Black?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN [reassuring]
    </p>
    <p>
      O... yes, that would be Ali. A queer old customer, Mary; perfectly
      harmless. Our firm gets hundreds of carpets through him; and then one
      day...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is he doing here, John?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, one day he turned up in London; broke, he said; and wanted the firm
      to give him a little cash. Well, old Briggs was for giving him ten
      shillings. But I said "here's a man that's helped us in making thousands
      of pounds. Let's give him fifty."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty pounds!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it seems a lot; but it seemed only fair. Ten shillings would have
      been an insult to the old fellow, and he'd have taken it as such. You
      don't know what he'd have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he doesn't want more?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I expect he's come to thank me. He seemed pretty keen on getting some
      cash. Badly broke, you see. Don't know what he was doing in London. Never
      can tell with these fellows. East is East, and there's an end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      How did he trace you here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, got the address at the office. Briggs and Cater won't let theirs be
      known. Not got such a smart little house, I expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't like letting people in that you don't know where they come from.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, he comes from the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I&mdash;I know. But the East doesn't seem quite to count, somehow, as
      the proper sort of place to come from, does it, dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      It's not like Sydenham or Bromley, some place you can put your finger on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps just for once, I don't think there's any harm in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, just for once. But we can't make a practice of it. And you don't
      want to be thinking of business on a Sunday, your only day off.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, it isn't business, you know. He only wants to say thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope he won't say it in some queer Eastern way. You don't know what
      these people....
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, no. Show him up, Liza.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      As you like, mum. [Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      And you gave him fifty pounds?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, old Briggs agreed to it. So I suppose that's what he got. Cater paid
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems a lot of money. But I think, as the man is actually coming up the
      stairs, I'm glad he's got something to be grateful for.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter ALI, shown in by LIZA.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Protector of the Just.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, er&mdash;yes. Good evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      My soul was parched and you bathed it in rivers of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, ah, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherefore the name Briggs, Cater, and Beal shall be magnified and called
      blessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Ha, yes. Very good of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALI [advancing, handing trinket]
    </p>
    <p>
      Protector of the Just, my offering.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Your offering?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Hush. It is beyond price. I am not bidden to sell it. I was in my
      extremity, but I was not bidden to sell it. It is a token of gratitude, a
      gift, as it came to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      As it came to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was given me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I see. Then you had given somebody what you call rivers of gold?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Not gold; it was in Sahara.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, and what do you give in the Sahara instead of gold?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Water.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I see. You got it for a glass of water, like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      And&mdash;and what happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I wouldn't take his only crystal, dear. It's a nice little thing, but [to
      ALI], but you think a lot of it, don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      But look here, what does it do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Much.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      He that taketh this crystal, so, in his hand, at night, and wishes, saying
      "At a certain hour let it be"; the hour comes and he will go back eight,
      ten, even twelve years if he will, into the past, and do a thing again, or
      act otherwise than he did. The day passes; the ten years are accomplished
      once again; he is here once more; but he is what he might have become had
      he done that one thing otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      John!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I&mdash;I don't understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night you wish. All to-morrow you live the last ten years; a new way,
      master, a new way, how you please. To-morrow night you are here, what
      those years have made you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      By Jove!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Have nothing to do with it, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      All right, Mary, I'm not going to. But, do you mean one could go back ten
      years?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it seems odd, but I'll take your word for it. But look here, you
      can't live ten years in a day, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      My master has power over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      John, don't have anything to do with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      All right, Mary. But who is your master?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      He is carved of one piece of jade, a god in the greenest mountains. The
      years are his dreams. This crystal is his treasure. Guard it safely, for
      his power is in this more than in all the peaks of his native hills. See
      what I give you, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, really, it's very good of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Good night, Mr. Ali. We are very much obliged for your kind offer, which
      we are so sorry we can't avail ourselves of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      One moment, Mary. Do you mean that I can go back ten years, and live till&mdash;till
      now again, and only be away a day?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Start early and you will be here before midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Would eight o'clock do!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      You could be back by eleven that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't quite see how ten years could go in a single day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      They will go as dreams go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, it seems rather unusual, doesn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Time is the slave of my master
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      John!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      All right, Mary. [In a lower voice.] I'm only trying to see what he'll
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      All right, John, only...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there no step that you would wish untrodden, nor stride that you would
      make where once you faltered?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I say, why don't you use it yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      I? I am afraid of the past. But you Engleesh, and the great firm of
      Briggs, Cater, and Beal; you are afraid of nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Ha, ha. Well&mdash;I wouldn't go quite as far as that, but&mdash;well,
      give me the crystal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't take it, John! Don't take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, Mary? It won't hurt me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      If it can do all that&mdash;if it can do all that...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, you might never have met me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Never have met you? I never thought of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Leave the past alone, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      All right, Mary. I needn't use it. But I want to hear about it, it's so
      odd, it's so what-you-might-call queer; I don't think I ever&mdash;&mdash;-
      [To ALI.] You mean if I work hard for ten years, which will only be all
      to-morrow, I may be Governor of the Bank of England to-morrow night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      O, don't do it, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      But you said&mdash;I'll be back here before midnight to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      It is so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Governor of the Bank of England would live in the City, and he'd
      have a much bigger house anyway. He wouldn't live in Lewisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      The crystal will bring you to this house when the hour is accomplished,
      even tomorrow night. If you be the great banker you will perhaps come to
      chastise one of your slaves who will dwell in this house. If you be head
      of Briggs and Cater you will come to give an edict to one of your firm.
      Perchance this street will be yours and you will come to show your power
      unto it. But you will come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      And if the house is not mine?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      John! John! Don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Still you will come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall I remember?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      If I want to do anything different to what I did, how shall I remember
      when I get back there?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't. Don't do anything different, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      All right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose just before the hour of the step you desire to change. Memory
      lingers a little at first, and fades away slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Even ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I can change one thing. After that I forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so. One thing. And the rest follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it's very good of you to make me this nice present, I'm sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      Sell it not. Give it, as I gave it, if the heart impels. So shall it come
      back one day to the hills that are brighter than grass, made richer by the
      gratitude of many men. And my master shall smile thereat and the vale
      shall be glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      It's very good of you, I'm sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't like it, John. I don't like tampering with what's gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ALI
    </p>
    <p>
      My master's power is in your hands. Farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I say, he's gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      O, he's a dreadful man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I never really meant to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      O, John, I wish you hadn't
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? I'm not going to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Not going to use it, John?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no. Not if you don't want me to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      O, I'm so glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      And besides, I don't want things different. I've got fond of this little
      house. And Briggs is a good old sort, you know. Cater's a bit of an ass,
      but there's no harm in him. In fact, I'm contented, Mary. I wouldn't even
      change Aunt Martha now.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Points at frowning framed photograph centrally hung.]
    </p>
    <p>
      You remember when she first came and you said "Where shall we hang her?" I
      said the cellar. You said we couldn't. So she had to go there. But I
      wouldn't change her now. I suppose there are old watch-dogs like her in
      every family. I wouldn't change anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      O, John, wouldn't you really?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I'm contented. Grim old soul, I wouldn't even change Aunt Martha.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm glad of that, John. I was frightened. I couldn't bear to tamper with
      the past. You don't know what it is, it's what's gone. But if it really
      isn't gone at all, if it can be dug up like that, why you don't know what
      mightn't happen! I don't mind the future, but if the past can come back
      like that.... O, don't, don't, John. Don't think of it. It isn't canny.
      There's the children, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes, that's all right. It's only a little ornament. I won't use it.
      And I tell you I'm content. [Happily] It's no use to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm so glad you're content, John. Are you really? Is there nothing that
      you'd have had different? I sometimes thought you'd rather that Jane had
      been a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a bit of it. Well, I may have at the time, but Arthur's good enough
      for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm so glad. And there's nothing you ever regret at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing. And you? Is there nothing you regret, Mary?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Me? Oh, no. I still think that sofa would have been better green, but you
      would have it red.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, so I would. No, there's nothing I regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't suppose there's many men can say that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I don't suppose they can. They're not all married to you. I don't
      suppose many of them can.
    </p>
    <p>
      [MARY smiles.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I should think that very few could say that they regretted nothing... very
      few in the whole world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I won't say nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      What is it you regret, John?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, there is one thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      And what is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing has rankled a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, John?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, it's nothing, it's nothing worth mentioning. But it rankled for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it, John?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, it seems silly to mention it. It was nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      But what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, well, if you want to know, it was once when I missed a train. I don't
      mind missing a train, but it was the way the porter pushed me out of the
      way. He pushed me by the face. I couldn't hit back, because, well, you
      know what lawyers make of it; I might have been ruined. So it just
      rankled. It was years ago before we married.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Pushed you by the face. Good gracious!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I'd like to have caught that train in spite of him. I sometimes think
      of it still. Silly of me, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      What a brute of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, I suppose he was doing his silly duty. But it rankled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      He'd no right to do any such thing! He'd no right to touch you!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, well, never mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I should like to have been there... I'd have...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, well, it can't be helped now; but I'd like to have caught it in sp...
      [An idea seizes him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Can't be helped, I said. It's the very thing that can be helped.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Can be helped, John? Whatever do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean he'd no right to stop me catching that train. I've got the crystal,
      and I'll catch it yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      O, John, that's what you said you wouldn't do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No. I said I'd do nothing to alter the past. And I won't. I'm too content,
      Mary. But this can't alter it. This is nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      What were you going to catch the train for, John?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      For London. I wasn't at the office then. It was a business appointment.
      There was a man who had promised to get me a job, and I was going up to...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      John, it may alter your whole life!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Now do listen, Mary, do listen. He never turned up. I got a letter from
      him apologising to me before I posted mine to him. It turned out he never
      meant to help me, mere meaningless affabilities. He never came to London
      that day at all. I should have taken the next train back. That can't
      affect the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      N-no, John. Still, I don't like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      What difference could it make?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      N-n-no.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Think how we met. We met at ARCHIE's wedding. I take it one has to go to
      one's brother's wedding. It would take a pretty big change to alter that.
      And. you were her bridesmaid. We were bound to meet. And having once met,
      well, there you are. If we'd met by chance, in a train, or anything like
      that, well, then I admit some little change might alter it. But when we
      met at ARCHIE's wedding and you were her bridesmaid, why, Mary, it's a
      cert. Besides, I believe in predestination. It was our fate; we couldn't
      have missed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I suppose not; still..
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, Mary, I have so longed to catch that infernal train. Just think of it,
      annoyed on and off for ten years by the eight-fifteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd rather you didn't, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      But why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      O, John, suppose there's a railway accident? You might be killed, and we
      should never meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      There wasn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      There wasn't, John? What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      There wasn't an accident to the eight-fifteen. It got safely to London
      just ten years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, nor there was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      You see how groundless your fears are. I shall catch that train, and all
      the rest will happen the same as before. Just think Mary, all those old
      days again. I wish I could take you with me. But you soon will be. But
      just think of the old days coming back again. Hampton Court again and Kew,
      and Richmond Park again with all the May. And that bun you bought, and the
      corked ginger-beer, and those birds singing and the 'bus past Isleworth.
      O, Mary, you wouldn't grudge me that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, well then all right, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      And you will remember there wasn't an accident, won't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY [resignedly, sadly]
    </p>
    <p>
      O, yes, John. And you won't try to get rich or do anything silly, will
      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Mary. I only want to catch that train. I'm content with the rest. The
      same things must happen, and they must lead me the same way, to you, Mary.
      Good night, now, dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Good night?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall stay here on the sofa holding the crystal and thinking. Then I'll
      have a biscuit and start at seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking, John? What about?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting it clear in my mind what I want to do. That one thing and the rest
      the same. There must be no mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY [sadly]
    </p>
    <p>
      Good night, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Have supper ready at eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Very well, John. [Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN [on the sofa, after a moment or two]
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll catch that infernal train in spite of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He takes the crystal and closes it up in the palm of his left hand.]
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish to go back ten years, two weeks and a day, at, at&mdash;8.10 a.m.
      to-morrow; 8.10 a.m. to-morrow, 8.10.
    </p>

      [Re-enter MARY in doorway.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      John! John! You are sure he did get his fifty pounds?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Didn't he come to thank me for the money?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      You are sure it wasn't ten shillings?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Cater paid him, I didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you sure that Cater didn't give him ten shillings?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      It's the sort of silly thing Cater would have done!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      O, John!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Hmm.

      Wot about? I'll tell yer. Just coz I let a lidy get into a train. That's
      wot about. Said I ought to 'av stopped 'er. Thought the train was moving.
      Thought it was dangerous. Thought I tried to murder 'er, I suppose.

      Wot? The other day?

    <p>
      Yes.

    <p>
      Tuesday?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? The one that dropped her bag?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Drops 'er bag. Writes to the company. They writes back she shouldn't
      'av got in. She writes back she should. Then they gets on to me. Any more
      of it and I'll...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      I wouldn't, Bill; don't you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't you, Bill. You've got your family to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, anyway, I won't let any more of them passengers go jumping into
      trains any more, not when they're moving, I won't. When the train gets in,
      doors shut. That's the rule, and they'll have to abide by it.

      [Enter JOHN BEAL.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL [touching his hat] Good morning, sir.

    <p>
      [JOHN does not answer, but walks to the door between them.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Carry your bag, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN

      Go to hell!

    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I never did. Why, I knows the young feller.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BERT
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleasant spoken, ain't 'e, as a rule?

    <p>
      Never knew 'im like this.

      You ain't bin sayin' nothing to 'im, 'ave yer?

      <br /> BILL
    </p>
    <p>
      Never in my life.

    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I never.

      <br /> SCENE 4
    </p>
    <p>
      In a second-class railway carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time: Same morning as Scene 1, Act I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noise, and a scene drawn past the windows. The scene, showing a momentary
      glimpse of fair English hills, is almost entirely placards, "GIVE HER
      BOVRIL," "GIVE HER OXO," alternately, for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occupants, JOHN BEAL, a girl, a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      All sit in stoical silence like the two images near Luxor. The man has the
      window seat, and therefore the right of control over the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA CLEMENT
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you mind having the window open?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MAN IN THE CORNER [shrugging his shoulders in a shivery way]
    </p>
    <p>
      Er&mdash;certainly. [Meaning he does not mind. He opens the window.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA CLEMENT
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MAN IN THE CORNER
    </p>
    <p>
      Not at all. [He does not mean to contradict her. Stoical silence again.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA CLEMENT
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you mind having it shut now? I think it is rather cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MAN IN THE CORNER
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He shuts it. Silence again.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA CLEMENT
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I'd like the window open again now for a bit. It is rather stuffy,
      isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MAN IN THE CORNER
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I think it's very cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA CLEMENT
    </p>
    <p>
      O, do you? But would you mind opening it for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MAN IN THE CORNER
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd much rather it was shut, if you don't mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She sighs, moves her hands slightly, and her pretty face expresses the
      resignation of the Christian martyr in the presence of lions. This for the
      benefit of John.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Allow me, madam.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He leans across the window's rightful owner, a bigger man than he, and
      opens his window.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAN IN THE CORNER shrugs his shoulders and, quite sensibly, turns to his
      paper.]

    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      O, thank you so much.

      <br /> JOHN

      Don't mention it.

      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Could you tell me where this is?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Elephant and Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you so much. It was kind of you to protect me from that horrid man.
      He wanted to suffocate me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, very glad to assist you, I'm sure. Very glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I should have been afraid to have done it in spite of him. It was splendid
      of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, that was nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      O, it was, really.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Only too glad to help you in any little way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so kind of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Silence for a bit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I've nobody to help me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Er, er, haven't you really?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      No, nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd be very glad to help you in any little way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder if you could advise me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I&mdash;I'd do my best.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, I have nobody to advise me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, of course not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I live with my aunt, and she doesn't understand. I've no father or mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, er, er, really?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      No. And an uncle died and he left me a hundred thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Really?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. He didn't like me. I think he did it out of contrariness as much as
      anything. He was always like that to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he? Was he really?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. It was invested at twenty-five per cent. He never liked me. Thought I
      was too&mdash;I don't know what.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      That was five years ago, and I've never got a penny of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Really. But, but that's not right.
    </p>
    <p>
      MIRALDA [sadly]
    </p>
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Where's it invested?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      In Al Shaldomir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Where's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't quite know. I never was good at geography. I never quite knew
      where Persia ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      And what kind of an investment was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a pass in some mountains that they can get camels over, and a huge
      toll is levied on everything that goes by; that is the custom of the tribe
      that lives there, and I believe the toll is regularly collected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      And who gets it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief of the tribe. He is called Ben Hussein. But my uncle lent him
      all this money, and the toll on the camels was what they call the
      security. They always carry gold and turquoise, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Do they?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, they get it from the rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      It does seem a shame his not paying, doesn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      A shame? I should think it is. An awful shame. Why, it's a crying shame.
      He ought to go to prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he ought. But you see it's so hard to find him. It isn't as if it was
      this side of Persia. It's being on the other side that is such a pity. If
      only it was in a country like, like...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd soon find him. I'd... Why, a man like that deserves anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      It is good of you to say that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, I'd... And you say you never got a penny?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that is a shame. I call that a downright shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, what ought I to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Do? Well, now, you know in business there's nothing like being on the
      spot. When you're on the spot you can&mdash;but then, of course, it's so
      far.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, I think you should go if you could. If only I could offer to help
      you in any way, I would gladly, but of course...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      What would you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd go and find that Hussein fellow; and then...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, I'd tell him a bit about the law, and make him see that you didn't
      keep all that money that belonged to someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you really?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing would please me better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you really? Would you go all that way?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      It's just the sort of thing that I should like, apart from the crying
      shame. The man ought to be...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      We're getting into Holborn. Would you come and lunch somewhere with me and
      talk it over?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Gladly. I'd be glad to help. I've got to see a man on business first. I've
      come up to see him. And then after that, after that there was something I
      wanted to do after that. I can't think what it was. But something I wanted
      to do after that. O, heavens, what was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      [Pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Can't you think?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No. O, well, it can't have been so very important. And yet... Well, where
      shall we lunch?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Gratzenheim's.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Right. What time?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      One-thirty. Would that suit?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfectly. I'd like to get a man like Hussein in prison. I'd like... O, I
      beg your pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He hurries to open the door. Exit MIRALDA.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Now what was it I wanted to do afterwards?

      JOHN's tent in Al Shaldomir. There are two heaps of idols, left and right,
      lying upon the ground inside the tent. DAOUD carries another idol in his
      arms. JOHN looks at its face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months have elapsed since the scene in the second-class railway
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      This god is holy.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He points to the left heap. DAOUD carries it there and lays it on the
      heap.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, great master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      You are in no wise to call me great master. Have not I said so? I am not
      your master. I am helping you people. I know better than you what you
      ought to do, because I am English. But that's all. I'm not your master,
      See?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, great master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, go and get some more idols. Hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Great master, I go. [Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't make these people out.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAOUD [returning]
    </p>
    <p>
      I have three gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN BEAL [looking at their faces, pointing to the two smaller idols
      first] These two are holy. This one is unholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, great master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Put them on the heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      [DAOUD does so, two left, one right.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Get some more.
    </p>
    <p>
      [DAOUD salaams. Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Looking at right heap.] What a&mdash;what a filthy people
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter DAOUD with two idols.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN BEAL [after scrutiny]
    </p>
    <p>
      This god is holy, this is unholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter ARCHIE BEAL, wearing a "Bowler" hat.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, ARCHIE, this is splendid of you! You've come! Why, that's splendid!
      All that way!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I've come. Whatever are you doing?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      ARCHIE, it's grand of you to come! I never ought to have asked it of you,
      only...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, that's all right. But what in the world are you doing?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      ARCHIE, it's splendid of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, cut it. That's all right. But what's all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, this. Well, well they're the very oddest people here. It's a long
      story. But I wanted to tell you first how enormously grateful I am to you
      for coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, that's all right. But I want to know what you're doing with all these
      genuine antiques.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, ARCHIE, the fact of it is they're a real odd lot of people here.
      I've learnt their language, more or less, but I don't think I quite
      understand them yet. A lot of them are Mahommedans; they worship Mahommed,
      you know. He's dead. But a lot of them worship these things, and...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what have you got 'em all in here for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that's just it. I hate interfering with them, but, well, I simply had
      to. You see there's two sorts of idols here; they offer fruit and rats to
      some of them; they lay them on their hands or their laps.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why do they offer them rats?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, I don't know. They don't know either. It's the right thing to do out
      here, it's been the right thing for hundreds of years; nobody exactly
      knows why. It's like the bows we have on evening shoes, or anything else.
      But it's all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what are you putting them in heaps for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Because there's the other kind, the ones with wide mouths and rust round
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Rust? Yes, so there is. What do they do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      They offer blood to them, ARCHIE. They pour it down their throats.
      Sometimes they kill people, sometimes they only bleed them. It depends how
      much blood the idol wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      How much blood it wants? Good Lord! How do they know?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      The priests tell them. Sometimes they fill them up to their necks&mdash;they're
      all hollow, you know. In spring it's awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why are they worse in spring?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know. The priests ask for more blood then. Much more. They say it
      always was so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      And you're stopping it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I'm stopping these. One must. I'm letting them worship those. Of
      course, it's idolatry and all that kind of thing, but I don't like
      interfering short of actual murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      And they're obeying you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      'M, y-yes. I think so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      You must have got a great hold over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I don't know about that. It's the pass that counts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      The pass?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that place you came over. It's the only way anyone can get here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I suppose it is. But how does the pass affect these idols?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      It affects everything here. If that pass were closed no living man would
      ever enter or leave, or even hear of, this country. It's absolutely cut
      off except for that one pass. Why, ARCHIE, it isn't even on the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, whoever owns that pass is everybody. No one else counts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      And who does own it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it's actually owned by a fellow called Hussein, but Miss Clement's
      uncle, a man called Hinnard, a kind of lonely explorer, seems to have come
      this way; and I think he understood what this pass is worth. Anyhow, he
      lent Hussein a big sum of money and got an acknowledgment from Hussein.
      Old Hinnard must have been a wonderfully shrewd man. For that
      acknowledgment is no more legal than an I.O.U., and Hussein is simply a
      brigand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Not very good security.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you're wrong there. Hussein himself respects that piece of parchment
      he signed. There's the name of some god or other written on it Hussein is
      frightened of. Now you see how things are. That pass is as holy as all the
      gods that there are in Al Shaldomir. Hussein possesses it. But he owes an
      enormous sum to Miss Miralda Clement, and I am here as her agent; and
      you've come to help me like a great sportsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, never mind that. Well, it all seems pretty simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I don't know, ARCHIE. Hussein admits the debt, but...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know what he'll do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Wants watching, does he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. And meanwhile I feel sort of responsible for all these silly people.
      Somebody's got to look after them. Daoud!
    </p>
    <p>
      DAOUD [off]
    </p>
    <p>
      Great master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Bring in some more gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, great master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't get them to stop calling me absurd titles. They're so infernally
      Oriental.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter DAOUD.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      He's got two big ones this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN BEAL [to ARCHIE]
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, there is rust about their mouths. [To DAOUD]: They are both
      unholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He points to R. heap, and DAOUD puts them there. To DAOUD.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Bring in some more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Great master, there are no more gods in Al Shaldomir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      What orders, great master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Listen. At night you shall come and take these gods away. These shall be
      worshipped again in their own place, these you shall cast into the great
      river and tell no man where you cast them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, great master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      You will do this, Daoud?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, great master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sorry to make you do it. You are sad that you have to do it. Yet it
      must be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I am sad, great master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But why are you sad, Daoud?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Great master, in times you do not know these gods were holy. In times you
      have not guessed. In old centuries, master, perhaps before the pass. Men
      have prayed to them, sorrowed before them, given offerings to them. The
      light of old hearths has shone on them, flames from old battles. The
      shadow of the mountains has fallen on them, so many times, master, so many
      times. Dawn and sunset have shone on them, master, like firelight
      flickering; dawn and sunset, dawn and sunset, flicker, flicker, flicker
      for century after century. They have sat there watching the dawns like old
      men by the fire. They are so old, master, so old. And some day dawn and
      sunset will die away and shine on the world no more, and they would have
      still sat on in the cold. And now they go... They are our history, master,
      they are our old times. Though they be bad times they are our times,
      master; and now they go. I am sad, master, when the old gods go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But they are bad gods, Daoud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sad when the bad gods go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      They must go, Daoud. See, there is no one watching. Take them now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, great master.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He takes up the largest of the gods with rust.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Come, Aho-oomlah, thou shalt not drink Nideesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Nideesh to have been sacrificed?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to have been drunk by Aho-oomlah.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Nideesh. Who is he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      He is my son.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exit with Aho-oomlah. JOHN BEAL almost gasps.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ARCHIE BEAL [who has been looking round the tent]
    </p>
    <p>
      What has he been saying?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      They're&mdash;they're a strange people. I can't make them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Is that the heap that oughtn't to be worshipped?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, do you know, I'm going to chuck this hat there. It doesn't seem to
      me somehow to be any more right here than those idols would be at home.
      Odd isn't it? Here goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He throws hat on right heap of idols. JOHN BEAL does not smile.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, what's the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't like to see a decent Christian hat among these filthy idols.
      They've all got rust on their mouths. I don't like to see it, Archie; it's
      sort of like what they call an omen. I don't like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Do they keep malaria here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't think so. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Then what's the matter, Johnny? Your nerves are bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      You don't know these people, and I've brought you out here. I feel kind of
      responsible. If Hussein's lot turn nasty you don't know what he'd do, with
      all those idols and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      He'll give 'em a drink, you mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't, ARCHIE. There's no saying. And I feel responsible for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, they can have my hat. It looks silly, somehow. I don't know why.
      What are we going to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, now that you've come we can go ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Righto. What at?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      We've got to see Hussein's accounts, and get everything clear in black and
      white, and see just what he owes to Miss Miralda Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But they don't keep accounts here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      How do you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, of course they don't. One can see that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But they must.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you haven't changed a bit for your six months here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Haven't changed?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      No. Just quietly thinking of business. You'll be a great business man,
      Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But we must do business; that's what I came here for.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll never make these people do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what do you suggest?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's have a look at old Hussein.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that's what I have been waiting for. Daoud!
    </p>
    <p>
      DAOUD [off]
    </p>
    <p>
      Master. [Enters.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Go to the palace of the Lord of the pass and beat on the outer door. Say
      that I desire to see him. Pray him to come to my tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      [DAOUD bows and Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [To ARCHIE.] I've sent him to the palace to ask Hussein to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Lives in a palace, does he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it's a palace, it's a wonderful place. It's bigger than the Mansion
      House, much.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      And you're going to teach him to keep accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I must. I hate doing it. It seems almost like being rude to the Lord
      Mayor. But there's two things I can't stand&mdash;cheating in business is
      one and murder's another. I've got to interfere. You see, if one happens
      to know the right from wrong as we do, we've simply got to tell people who
      don't. But it isn't pleasant. I almost wish I'd never come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, it's the greatest sport in the world. It's splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't see it that way. To me those idols are just horrid murder. And
      this man owes money to this girl with no one to look after her, and he's
      got to pay. But I hate being rude to a man in a place like the Mansion
      House, even if he is black. Why, good Lord, who am I? It seems such cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I say, Johnny, tell me about the lady. Is she pretty?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      What, Miss Miralda? Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But what I mean is&mdash;what's she like?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I don't know. It's very hard to say. She's, she's tall and she's fair
      and she's got blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, but I mean what kind of a person is she? How does she strike you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she's pretty hard up until she gets this money, and she hasn't got
      any job that's any good, and no real prospects bar this, and nobody
      particular by birth, and doesn't know anybody who is, and lives in the
      least fashionable suburb and can only just afford a second-class fare
      and...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes, go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet somehow she sort of seems like a&mdash;like a queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord above us! And what kind of a queen?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, I don't know. Well, look here, ARCHIE, it's only my impression. I don't
      know her well yet. It's only my impression. I only tell you in absolute
      confidence. You won't pass it on to anybody, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, no. Go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I don't know, only she seemed more like well, a kind of autocrat,
      you know, who'd stop at nothing. Well, no, I don't mean that, only...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      So you're not going to marry her?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Marry her! Good Lord, no. Why, you'd never dare ask her. She's not that
      sort. I tell you she's a sort of queen. And (Good Lord!) she'd be a queen
      if it wasn't for Hussein, or something very like one. We can't go marrying
      queens. Anyhow, not one like her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why not one like her?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell you&mdash;she's a&mdash;well, a kind of goddess. You couldn't ask
      her if she loved you. It would be such, such...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Such what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Such infernal cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I see. Well, I see you aren't in love with her. But it seems to me you'll
      be seeing a good deal of her some day if we pull this off. And then, my
      boy-o, you'll be going and getting in love with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell you I daren't. I'd as soon propose to the Queen of Sheba.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Johnny, I'm going to protect you from her all I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Protect me from her? Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, because there's lots of other girls and it seems to me you might be
      happier with some of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But you haven't even seen her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor I have. Still, if I'm here to protect you I somehow think I will. And
      if I'm not ...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, and what then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      What nonsense I'm talking. Fate does everything. I can't protect you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it's nonsense all right, ARCHIE, but...
    </p>
    <p>
      HUSSEIN [off]
    </p>
    <p>
      I am here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      [HUSSEIN enters. He is not unlike Bluebeard.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN BEAL [pointing to ARCHIE] My brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      [ARCHIE shakes hands with HUSSEIN. HUSSEIN looks at his hand when it is
      over in a puzzled way. JOHN BEAL and Hussein then bow to each other.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      You desired my presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I am honoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      And I.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      The white traveller, whom we call Hinnard, lent you one thousand greater
      gold pieces, which in our money is one hundred thousand pounds, as you
      acknowledge. [Hussein nods his head.] And every year you were to pay him
      for this two hundred and fifty of your greater gold pieces&mdash;as you
      acknowledge also.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      And this you have not yet had chance to pay, but owe it still.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Hinnard is dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace be with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      His heiress is Miss Miralda Clement, who instructs me to be her agent.
      What have you to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace be with Hinnard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge your debt to this lady, Miss Miralda Clement?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      I know her not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      You will not pay your debt?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      I will pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      If you bring the gold to my tent, my brother will take it to Miss Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not pay to Miss Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      To whom do you pay?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      I pay to Hinnard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Hinnard is dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      I pay to Hinnard.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      How will you pay to Hinnard?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      If he be buried in the sea...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      He is not buried at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      If he be buried by any river I go to the god of rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      He is buried on land near no river.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore I will go to a bronze god of earth, very holy, having the soil
      in his care and the things of earth. I will take unto him the greater
      pieces of gold due up to the year when the white traveller died, and will
      melt them in fire at his feet by night on the mountains, saying, "O,
      Lruru-onn (this is his name) take this by the way of earth to the grave of
      Hinnard." And so I shall be free of my debt before all gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But not before me. I am English. And we are greater than gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      What's that, Johnny?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      He won't pay, but I told him we're English and that they're greater than
      all his bronze gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      That's right, Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      [HUSSEIN looks fiercely at ARCHIE. He sees ARCHIE's hat lying before a big
      idol. He points at the hat and looks in the face of the idol.]
    </p>
    <p>
      HUSSEIN [to the idol] Drink! Drink!
    </p>
    <p>
      [He bows. Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      What's that he's saying?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN BEAL [meditatively] O, nothing&mdash;nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      He won't pay, oh?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not to Miss Miralda.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Who to?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      To one of his gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      That won't do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      What'll we do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't quite know. It isn't as if we were in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      No, it isn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      If we were in England...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I know; if we were in England you could call a policeman. I tell you what
      it is, Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell you what; you want to see more of Miss Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, because at the present moment our friend Hussein is a craftier fellow
      than you, and looks like getting the best of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      How will seeing more of Miss Miralda help us?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, because you want to be a bit craftier than Hussein, and I fancy she
      might make you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      She? How?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      We're mostly made what we are by some woman or other. We think it's our
      own cleverness, but we're wrong. As things are you're no match for
      Hussein, but if you altered...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, ARCHIE; where did you get all those ideas from?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      You never used to talk like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      You haven't been getting in love, ARCHIE, have you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      What are we to do about Hussein?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      It's funny your mentioning Miss Miralda. I got a letter from her the same
      day I got yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      What does she say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I couldn't make it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      What were her words?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      She said she was going into it closer. She underlined closer. What could
      she mean by that? How could she get closer?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the same way as I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      How do you mean? I don't understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      By coming here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      By coming here? But she can't come here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Because it's impossible. Absolutely impossible. Why&mdash;good Lord&mdash;she
      couldn't come here. Why, she'd want a chaperon and a house and&mdash;and&mdash;everything.
      Good Lord, she couldn't come here. It would be&mdash;well it would be
      impossible&mdash;it couldn't be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, all right. Then I don't know what she meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      ARCHIE! You don't really think she'd come here? You don't really think it,
      do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it's the sort of thing that that sort of girl might do, but of
      course I can't say...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Good Lord, ARCHIE! That would be awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? But what would I do? Where would she go? Where would her chaperon go?
      The chaperon would be some elderly lady. Why, it would kill her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, if it did you've never met her, so you needn't go into mourning for
      an elderly lady that you don't know; not yet, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      No, of course not. You're laughing at me, ARCHIE. But for the moment I
      took you seriously. Of course, she won't come. One can go into a thing
      closely without doing it absolutely literally. But, good Lord, wouldn't it
      be an awful situation if she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      All alone with me here? No, impossible. And the country isn't civilised.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women aren't civilised.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Women aren't...? Good Lord, ARCHIE, what an awful remark. What do you
      mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      We're tame, they're wild. We like all the dull things and the quiet
      things, they like all the romantic things and the dangerous things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, ARCHIE, it's just the other way about.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, yes; we do all the romantic things, and all the dangerous things. But
      why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? Because we like them, I suppose. I can't think of any other reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I hate danger. Don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Er&mdash;well, yes, I suppose I do, really.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course you do. We all do. It's the women that put us up to it. She's
      putting you up to this. And the more she puts you up to the more likely is
      Hussein to get it in his fat neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But&mdash;but you don't mean you'd hurt Hussein? Not&mdash;not badly, I
      mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      We're under her orders, Johnny. See what she says.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      You, you don't really think she'll come here?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I do, and the best thing too. It's her show; she ought to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But, but you don't understand. She's just a young girl, A girl like Miss
      Miralda couldn't come out here over the pass and down these mountains,
      she'd never stand it, and as for the chaperon... You've never met Miss
      Miralda.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Johnny. But the girl that was able to get you to go from Bromley to
      this place can look after herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't see what that's got to do with it. She was in trouble and I had to
      help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, and she'll be in trouble all the way here from Blackheath, and
      everyone will have to help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      What beats me is how you can have the very faintest inkling of what she's
      like without ever having seen her and without my having spoken of her to
      you for more than a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Johnny, you're not a romantic bird, you're not a traveller by
      nature, barring your one trip to Eastbourne, and it was I that took you
      there. And contrariwise, as they say in a book you've never read, you're a
      levelheaded business man and a hardworking respectable stay-at-home. You
      meet a girl in a train, and the next time I see you you're in a place that
      isn't marked on the map and telling it what gods it ought to worship and
      what gods it ought to have agnosticism about. Well, I say some girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I must say you make the most extraordinary deductions, but it was
      awfully good of you to come, and I ought to be grateful; and I am, too,
      I'm awfully grateful; and I ought to let you talk all the rot you like. Go
      ahead. You shall say what you like and do what you like. It isn't many
      brothers that would do what you've done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, that's nothing. I like this country. I'm glad I came. And if I can help
      you with Hussein, why all the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      It's an awful country, Archie, but we've got to see this through.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Does she know all about Hussein?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, everything. I've written fully.
    </p>
    <p>
      OMAR [Off]
    </p>
    <p>
      Al Shaldomir, Al Shaldomir, The nightingales that guard thy ways...
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN BEAL [shouting|
    </p>
    <p>
      O, go away, go away. [To ARCHIE.] I said it was an awful country. They sit
      down outside one's tent and do that kind of thing for no earthly reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, I'd let them sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, you can't have people doing that kind of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      OMAR [in doorway]
    </p>
    <p>
      Master, I go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But why do you come?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> OMAR
    </p>
    <p>
      I came to sing a joyous song to you, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did you want to sing me a joyous song?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> OMAR
    </p>
    <p>
      Because a lady is riding out of the West. [Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      A lady out of... Good Lord!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      She's coming, Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming? Good Lord, no, Archie. He said a lady; there'd be the chaperon
      too. There'd be two of them if it was Miss Miralda. But he said a lady.
      One lady. It can't be her. A girl like that alone in Al Shaldomir. Clean
      off the map. Oh, no, it isn't possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I wouldn't worry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Wouldn't worry? But, good Lord, the situation's impossible. People would
      talk. Don't you see what people would say? And where could they go? Who
      would look after them? Do try and understand how awful it is. But it
      isn't. It's impossible. It can't be them. For heaven's sake run out and
      see if it is; and (good Lord!) I haven't brushed my hair all day, and, and&mdash;oh,
      look at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He rushes to camp mirror. Exit ARCHIE.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN BEAL tidies up desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter ARCHIE.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      It's what you call THEM.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      What I call THEM? Whatever do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it's her. She's just like what you said.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But it can't be. She doesn't ride. She can never have been able to afford
      a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      She's on a camel. She'll be here in a moment. [He goes to door.] Hurry up
      with that hair; she's dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, Lord! What's the chaperon like?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, she's attending to that herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Attending to it herself? What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect she'll attend to most things.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter HAFIZ EL ALCOLAHN in doorway of tent, pulling back flap a little.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Who are you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      I show the gracious lady to your tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter MIRALDA CLEMENT, throwing a smile to HAFIZ.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Hullo, Mr. Beal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Er&mdash;er&mdash;how do you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      [She looks at ARCHIE.]
    </p>
    <p>
      O, this is my brother&mdash;Miss Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      MIRANDA and ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      How do you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I like this country.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm afraid I hardly expected you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Didn't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      No. You see er&mdash;it's such a long way. And wasn't it very expensive?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the captain of the ship was very kind to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O! But what did you do when you landed?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      O, there were some Arabs coming this way in a caravan. They were really
      very good to me too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But the camel?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      O, there were some people the other side of the mountains. Everybody has
      been very kind about it. And then there was the man who showed me here.
      He's called Hafiz el Alcolahn. It's a nice name, don't you think?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But, you know, this country, Miss Clement, I'm half afraid it's hardly&mdash;isn't
      it, Archie? Er&mdash;how long did you think of staying?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      O, a week or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know what you'll think of Al Shaldomir. I'm afraid you'll find
      it...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I like it. Just that hollow in the mountains, and the one pass, and no
      record of it anywhere. I like that. I think it's lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, I'm afraid&mdash;what I mean is I'm afraid the place isn't even
      on the map!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      O, that's lovely of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      All decent places are.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      You mean if a place is on the map we've got to behave accordingly. But if
      not, why...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Hussein won't pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's see Hussein.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm afraid he's rather, he's rather a savage-looking brigand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Never mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      [ARCHIE is quietly listening and smiling sometimes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter DAOUD. He goes up to the unholy heap and takes away two large idols,
      one under each arm. Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      What's that, Mr. Beal?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, that. I'm afraid it's rather horrible. I told you it was an awful
      country. They pray to these idols here, and some are all right, though of
      course it's terribly blasphemous, but that heap, well, I'm afraid, well
      that heap is very bad indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      What do they do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      They kill people.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Do they? How?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm afraid they pour their blood down those horrible throats.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Do they? How do you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I've seen them do it, and those mouths are all rusty. But it's all right
      now. It won't happen any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Won't it? Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      He's stopped them, Miss Clement. They're all going to be thrown into the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, yes. I had to. So it's all right now. They won't do it any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      H'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      What, what is it? I promise you that's all right. They won't do that any
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      H'm. I've never known anyone that tried to govern a country or anything of
      that sort, but...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I'm just doing what I can to put them right.... I'd be very
      glad of your advice... Of course, I'm only here in your name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      What I mean is that I'd always thought that the one thing you shouldn't
      do, if you don't mind my saying so...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      No, certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Was to interfere in people's religious beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But, but I don't think you quite understand. The priests knife these
      people in the throat, boys and girls, and then acolytes lift them up and
      the blood runs down. I've seen them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it's best to leave religion to the priests. They understand that
      kind of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      [JOHN BEAL opens his mouth in horror and looks at ARCHIE. ARCHIE returns
      the glance; there is very nearly a twinkle in ARCHIE's eyes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's see Hussein.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you think, Archie?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor fellow. We'd better send for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Why do you say "poor fellow"?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, because he's so much in debt. It's awful to be in debt. I'd sooner
      almost anything happened to me than to owe a lot of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Your remark didn't sound very complimentary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, I only meant that I'd hate to be in debt. And I should hate owing money
      to you, Because...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I should so awfully want to pay it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      That's all I meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Does Hussein awfully want to pay it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, no. But he hasn't seen you yet. He will then, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter DAOUD. He goes to the unholy heap.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Daoud, for the present these gods must stay. Aho-oomlah's gone, but the
      rest must stay for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, great master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Daoud, go once more to the palace of the Lord of the Pass and beat the
      outer door. Say that the great lady herself would see him. The great lady,
      Miss Clement, the white traveller's heiress.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Hasten.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exit DAOUD.]
    </p>
    <p>
      I have sent him for Hussein.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know their language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      You will see him, and I'll tell you what he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      MIRALDA [to ARCHIE]
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you been here long?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      No. I think he wrote to me by the same mail as he wrote to you (if they
      have mails here). I came at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      So did I; but you weren't on the Empress of Switzerland.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I came round more by land.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      You know, I hardly like bringing Hussein in here to see you. He's such a&mdash;he's
      rather a...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      What's the matter with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he's rather of the brigand type, and one doesn't know what he'll do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we must see him first and hear what he has to say before we take any
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But what do you propose to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, if he pays me everything he owes, or gives up the security...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      The security is the pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. If he gives up that or pays...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      You know he's practically king of the whole country. It seems rather cheek
      almost my sending for him like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      He must come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But what are you going to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      If he gives up the pass...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, if he gives up the pass you'd be you'd be a kind of queen of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, if he does that, all right...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But what if he doesn't?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, if he doesn't pay...
    </p>
    <p>
      HUSSEIN [off]
    </p>
    <p>
      I am here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter HUSSEIN.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HUSSEIN
    </p>
    <p>
      Greeting once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Again greeting.... The great lady, Miss Clement, is here.
    </p>
    <p>
      [HUSSEIN and MIRALDA look at each other.]
    </p>
    <p>
      You will pay to Miss Clement and not to your god of bronze. On the word of
      an Englishman, your god of bronze shall not have one gold piece that
      belongs to the great lady!
    </p>
    <p>
      HUSSEIN [looking contemptuous]
    </p>
    <p>
      On the word of the Lord of the Pass, I only pay to Hinnard.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He stands smiling while MIRALDA regards him. Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      He won't pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      What are we to do now?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN BEAL [to MIRALDA]
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm afraid he's rather an ugly customer to introduce you to like that. I'm
      sorry he came now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      O, I like him, I think he looks splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what are we to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you say, Miss Clement?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, what do you feel we ought to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, perhaps I ought to leave all that to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, no.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      No, it's your money. What do you think we really ought to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, of course, I think you ought to kill Hussein.
    </p>
    <p>
      [JOHN BEAL and ARCHIE BEAL look at each other a little startled.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But wouldn't that&mdash;wouldn't that be&mdash;murder?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      O, yes, according to the English law.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I see; you mean&mdash;you mean we're not&mdash;but we are English.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean it wouldn't be murder&mdash;by your law, unless you made it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      By my law?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, if you can interfere with their religion like this, and none of them
      say a word, why&mdash;you can make any laws you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hussein is king here; he is Lord of the Pass, and that's everything
      here. I'm nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      O, if you like to be nobody, of course that's different.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I think she means that if Hussein weren't there there'd be only you. Of
      course, I don't know. I've only just come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      But we can't kill Hussein!
    </p>
    <p>
      [MIRALDA begins to cry.]
    </p>
    <p>
      O Lord! Good heavens! Please, Miss Clement! I'm awfully sorry if I've said
      anything you didn't like. I wouldn't do that for worlds. I'm awfully
      sorry. It's a beastly country, I know. I'm really sorry you came. I feel
      it's all my fault. I'm really awfully sorry...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Never mind. Never mind. I was so helpless, and I asked you to help me. I
      never ought to have done it. I oughtn't to have spoken to you at all in
      that train without being introduced; but I was so helpless. And now, and
      now, I haven't a penny in the world, and, O, I don't know what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll do anything for you, Miss Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Anything in the wide world. Please, please don't cry. We'll do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I... I only, I only wanted to&mdash;to kill Hussein. But never mind, it
      doesn't matter now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll do it, Miss Clement, won't we, Archie? Only don't cry. We'll do it.
      I&mdash;I suppose he deserves it, doesn't he?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I suppose he does.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, all right, Miss Clement, that's settled. My brother and I will talk
      it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      MIRALDA [still sniping]
    </p>
    <p>
      And&mdash;and&mdash;don't hang him or anything&mdash;he looks so fine....
      I&mdash;I wouldn't like him treated like that. He has such a grand beard.
      He ought to die fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll see what we can do, Miss Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      It is sweet of you. It's really sweet. It's sweet of both of you. I don't
      know what I d have done without you. I seemed to know it that day the
      moment I saw you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, it's nothing, Miss Clement, nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      That's all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, now I'll have to look for an hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that's the trouble, that really is the trouble. That's what I've been
      thinking of
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, isn't there...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I'm afraid there isn't. What are we to do, Archie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I&mdash;I can't think. Perhaps Miss Clement would have a scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      MIRALDA [to JOHN BEAL]
    </p>
    <p>
      I rely on you, Mr. Beal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I&mdash;I; but what can I... You see, you're all alone. If you'd anyone
      with you, you could have...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I did think of bringing a rather nice aunt. But on the whole I thought it
      better not to tell anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to tell...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      No, on the whole I didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      I say, Archie, what are we to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's Daoud.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter DAOUD.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      The one man I trust in Al Shaldomir!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      I have brought two watchers of the doorstep to guard the noble lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      He says he's brought two watchers of the doorstep to look after Miss
      Clement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Two chaperons! Splendid! She can go anywhere now.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Well, really, that is better. Yes that will be all right. We can find a
      room for you now. The trouble was your being alone. I hope you'll like
      them. [To DAOUD.] Tell them to enter here.

      Ho! Enter!

    </p>
    <p>
      That's all right, ARCHIE, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> ARCHIE BEAL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that's all right. A chaperon's a chaperon, black or white.
    </p>

      You won't mind their being black, will you, Miss Clement?

    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I shan't mind. They can't be worse than white ones.

      fans and wearing scimitars. All stare at them. They begin to fan

                Where shall the lost lights fade away?

                Dawn is fled to the marshy hollows

                swallows
                 And all through summer the iris sway.
                 But where, my love, shall we dream to-day?

    </p>
    <p>
      John, John. I wish you'd marry me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Miralda, you're thinking of those old customs again that we left behind us
      seven years ago. What's the good of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a fancy that I wished you would.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      What's the good of it? You know you are my beloved. There are none of
      those clergymen within hundreds of miles. What's the good of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      We could find one, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, yes, I suppose we could, but...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Why won't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I told you why.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      O, yes, that instinct that you must not marry. That's not your reason,
      John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a silly reason. It's a crazy reason. It's no reason at all. There's
      some other reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, there isn't. But I feel that in my bones. I don't know why. You know
      that I love none else but you. Besides, we're never going back, and it
      doesn't matter. This isn't Blackheath.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      So I must live as your slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no, Miralda. My dear, you are not my slave. Did not the singer compare
      our love to the desire of the nightingale for the evening star? All know
      that you are my queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      They do not know at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Home? Home? How could they know? What have we in common with home? Rows
      and rows of little houses; and if they hear a nightingale there they write
      to the papers. And&mdash;and if they saw this they'd think they were
      drunk. Miralda, don't be absurd. What has set you thinking of home?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to be crowned queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      But I am not a king. I am only Shereef.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      You are all-powerful here, John, you can do what you please, if you wish
      to. You don't love me at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Miralda, you know I love you. Didn't I kill Hussein for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, but you don't love me now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      And Hussein's people killed ARCHIE. That was for you too. I brought my
      brother out here to help you. He was engaged to be married, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      But you don't love me now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I do. I love you as the dawn loves the iris marshes. You know the
      song they sing. (footnote: poem just before Act III)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Then why won't you marry me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I told you, I told you. I had a dream about the future. I forgot the
      dream, but I know I was not to marry. I will not wrong the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't be crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I will have what fancies I please, crazy or sane. Am I not Shereef of
      Shaldomir? Who dare stop me if I would be mad as Herod?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I will be crowned queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not my wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I will, I will, I will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Drive me not to anger. If I have you cast into a well and take twenty of
      the fairest daughters of Al Shaldomir in your place, who can gainsay me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I will be crowned queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, do not be tiresome.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it not my money that brought you here? Was it not I who said "Kill
      Hussein"? What power could you have had, had Hussein lived? What would you
      have been doing now, but for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know, Miralda.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Catching some silly train to the City. Working for some dull firm. Living
      in some small suburban house. It is I, I, that brought you from all that,
      and you won't make me a queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it not enough that you are my beloved? You know there is none other but
      you. Is it not enough, Miralda?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not enough. I will be queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Tchah!... Miralda, I know you are a wonderful woman, the most wonderful in
      the East; how you ever came to be in the West I don't know, and a train of
      all places; but, Miralda, you must not have petty whims, they don't become
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it a petty whim to wish to be a queen?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, when it is only the name you want. You are a queen. You have all you
      wish for. Are you not my beloved? And have I not power here over all men?
      Could I not close the pass?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to be queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh-h! I will leave you. I have more to do than to sit and hear your whims.
      When I come back you will have some other whim. Miralda, you have too many
      whims.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He rises.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Will you be back soon?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      When will you come back, John?
    </p>
    <p>
      [She is reclining, looking fair, fanning slightly.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.

    <p>
      [Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Her fan is laid down. She clutches it with sudden resolve. She goes to
      the wall, fanning herself slowly. She leans against it. She fans herself
      now with obvious deliberation. Three times the great fan goes pat against
      the window, and then again separately three times; and then she puts it
      against the window once with a smile of ecstasy. She has signalled. She
      returns to the cushions and reclines with beautiful care, fanning herself
      softly.

      Seven times, lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, was it? Well, now you're here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady, O star of these times. O light over lonely marshes. [He kneels by
      her and embraces her.] Is the Shereef gone, lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour, Hafiz.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      How know you for half an hour?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      He said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      He said so? Then is the time to fear, if a man say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I know him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      In our country who knows any man so much? None.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      He'll be away for half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAFIZ [embracing]
    </p>
    <p>
      O, exquisite lily of unattainable mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, Hafiz, would you do a little thing for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      I would do all things, lady, O evening star.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRANDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you make me a queen, Hafiz?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      If&mdash;if the Shereef were gathered?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, Hafiz.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady, I would make you queen of all that lies west of the passes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRANDA
    </p>
    <p>
      You would make me queen?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, before all my wives, before all women, over all Shaldomir, named
      the elect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      O, well, Hafiz; then you may kiss me. [HAFIZ does so ad lib.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Hafiz, the Shereef has irked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady, O singing star, to all men is the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      The appointed hour?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the appointed hour, the last, leading to darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it written, think you, that the Shereef's hour is soon?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady, O dawn's delight, let there be a banquet. Let the great ones of
      Shaldomir be bidden there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      There shall be a banquet, Hafiz.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, O lady. Let it be soon, sole lily of the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      It shall be soon, Hafiz. [More embraces.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      And above all, O lady, bid Daoud, the son of the baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      He shall be bidden, Hafiz.
    </p>

      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      O lady, it is well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Go now, Hafiz.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady, I go [giving a bag of gold to BAZZALOL]. Silence. Silence. Silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      BAZZALOL [kneeling]
    </p>
    <p>
      O, master!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the tomb speak; let the stars cry out; but do you be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BAZZALOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Aye, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAFIZ [to THOOTHOOBABA]
    </p>
    <p>
      And you. Though this one speak, yet be silent, or dread the shadow of
      Hafiz el Alcolahn.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He drops a bag of gold. THOOTHOOBABA goes down and grabs at the gold; his
      eyes gloat over it.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> THOOTHOOBABA
    </p>
    <p>
      Master, I speak not. Oh-h-h.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exit HAFIZ.
    </p>
    <p>
      MIRALDA arranges herself on the cushions. She looks idly at each Nubian.
      The Nubians put each a finger over his lips and go on fanning with one
      hand.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      A queen. I shall look sweet as a queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter JOHN. She rises to greet him caressingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter DAOUD.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, you have brought Daoud with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      You know that I don't like Daoud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish to speak with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      [MIRALDA looks straight at JOHN and moves away in silence. Exit L.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Daoud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Great master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Daoud, one day in spring, in the cemetery of those called Blessed, beyond
      the city's gates, you swore to me by the graves of both your parents....
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Great master, even so I swore.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      .... to be true to me always.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no Shereef but my master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Daoud, you have kept your word.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      I have sought to, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      You have helped me often, Daoud, warned me and helped me often. Through
      you I knew those currents that run through the deeps of the market, in
      silence and all men feel them, but a ruler never. You told me of them, and
      when I knew&mdash;then I could look after myself, Daoud. They could do
      nothing against me then. Well, now I hold this people. I hold them at
      last, Daoud, and now &mdash;well, I can rest a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Not in the East, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Not in the East, Daoud?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      No, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      In Western countries, master, whose tales I have read, in a wonderful book
      named the "Good Child's History of England," in the West a man hath power
      over a land, and lo! the power is his and descends to his son's son after
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, doesn't it in the East?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Not if he does not watch, master; in the night and the day, and in the
      twilight between the day and the night, and in the dawn between the night
      and the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought you had pretty long dynasties in these parts, and pretty lazy
      ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Master, he that was mightiest of those that were kings in Babylon had a
      secret door prepared in an inner chamber, which led to a little room, the
      smallest in the palace, whose back door opened secretly to the river, even
      to great Euphrates, where a small boat waited all the days of his reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he really now? Well, he was taking no chances. Did he have to use it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      No, master. Such boats are never used. Those that watch like that do not
      need to seek them, and the others, they would never be able to reach the
      river in time, even though the boat were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I shouldn't like to have to live like that. Why, a river runs by the back
      of this palace. I suppose palaces usually are on rivers. I'm glad I don't
      have to keep a boat there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      No, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what is it you are worrying about? Who is it you are afraid of?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Hafiz el Alcolahn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, Hafiz. I have no fears of Hafiz. Lately I ordered my spies to watch him
      no longer. Why does he hate me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Because, most excellent master, you slew Hussein.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Slew Hussein? What is that to do with him? May I not slay whom I please?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, master. Even so. But he was Hussein's enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      His enemy, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      For years he had dreamed of the joy of killing Hussein.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he should have done it before I came. We don't hang over things and
      brood over them for years where I come from. If a thing's to be done, it's
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, master. Hafiz had laid his plans for years. He would have killed
      him and got his substance; and then, when the hour drew near, you came,
      and Hussein died, swiftly, not as Hafiz would have had him die; and lo!
      thou art the lord of the pass, and Hafiz is no more than a beetle that
      runs about in the dirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, so you fear Hafiz?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for himself, master. Nay, I fear not Hafiz. But, master, hast thou
      seen when the thunder is coming, but no rumble is heard and the sky is
      scarce yet black, how little winds run in the grass and sigh and die; and
      the flower beckons a moment with its head; all the world full of whispers,
      master, all saying nothing; then the lightning, master, and the anger of
      God; and men say it came without warning? [Simply.] I hear those things
      coming, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Master, it is all silent in the market. Once, when the price of turquoises
      was high, men abused the Shereef. When the merchant men could not sell
      their pomegranates for silver they abused the Shereef. It is men's way,
      master, men's way. Now it is all silent in the market. It is like the
      grasses with the idle winds, that whisper and sigh and die away; like the
      flowers beckoning to nothing. And so, master, and so....
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I see, you fear some danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      I fear it, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      What danger, Daoud?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Master, I know not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      From what quarter, Daoud?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      O master, O sole Lord of Al Shaldomir, named the elect, from that quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      That quarter? Why, that is the gracious lady's innermost chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      From that quarter, great master, O Lord of the Pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Daoud, I have cast men into prison for saying less than this. Men have
      been flogged on the feet for less than this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Slay me, master, but hear my words.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not slay you. You are mistaken, Daoud. You have made a great
      mistake. The thing is absurd. Why, the gracious lady has scarcely seen
      Hafiz. She knows nothing of the talk of the market. Who could tell her? No
      one comes here. It is absurd. Only the other day she said to me... But it
      is absurd, it is absurd, Daoud. Besides, the people would never rebel
      against me. Do I not govern them well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should they rebel, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      They think of the old times, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      The old times? Why, their lives weren't safe. The robbers came down from
      the mountains and robbed the market whenever they had a mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Master, men were content in the old times.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      But were the merchants content?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Those that loved merchandise were content, master. Those that loved it not
      went into the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      But were they content when they were robbed?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon recovered their losses, master. Their prices were unjust and
      they loved usury.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      And were the people content with unjust prices?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Some were, master, as men have to be in all countries. The others went
      into the mountains and robbed the merchants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, master, a man robs a merchant and he is cast into prison. Now a
      man is slain in the market and his son, his own son, master, may not
      follow after the aggressor and slay him and burn his house. They are
      ill-content, master. No man robs the merchants, no man slays them, and the
      merchants' hearts are hardened and they oppress all men.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I see. They don't like good government?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      They sigh for the old times, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I see; I see. In spite of all I have done for them, they want their old
      bad government back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the old way, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes. And so they would rebel. Well, we must watch. You have warned me
      once again, Daoud, and I am grateful. But you are wrong, Daoud, about the
      gracious lady. You are mistaken. It is impossible. You are mistaken,
      Daoud. I know it could not be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      I am mistaken, master. Indeed, I am mistaken. Yet, watch. Watch, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I will watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      And, master, if ever I come to you bearing oars, then watch no longer,
      master, but follow me through the banquet chamber and through the room
      beyond it. Move as the wild deer move when there is danger, without
      pausing, without wondering, without turning round; for in that hour,
      master, in that hour....
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the room beyond the banquet chamber, Daoud?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Aye, master, following me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is no door beyond, Daoud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Master, I have prepared a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      A door, Daoud?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      A door none wots of, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Whither does it lead?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      To a room that you know not of, a little room; you must stoop, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, and then?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      To the river, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      The river! But there's no boat there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the golden willow, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      A boat?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, under the branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it come to that?... No, Daoud, all this is unnecessary. It can't come
      to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever I come before you bearing two oars, in that hour, master, it is
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      But you will not come. It will never come to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      No, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      A wise man can stop things before they get as far as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      They that were kings in Babylon were wise men, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Babylon! But that was thousands of years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Man changes not, master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Daoud, I will trust you, and if it ever comes to that...
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter MIRALDA.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA

    <p>
      I thought Daoud was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD

    <p>
      Even now I go, gracious lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exit DAOUD. Rather strained silence with JOHN and MIRALDA till he goes.
      She goes and retakes herself comfortable on the cushions. He is not
      entirely at ease.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      You had a long talk with Daoud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he came and talked a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      What about?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, just talk; you know these Eastern people.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it was something you were discussing with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, no.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Some important secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      You often talk with Daoud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he is useful to me. When he talks sense I listen, but to-day...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      What did he come for to-day?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      You have a secret with Daoud that you will not share with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I have not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it he said?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      He said there was a king in Babylon who...
    </p>
    <p>
      [DAOUD slips into the room.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      In Babylon? What has that to do with us?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing. I told you he was not talking sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what did he say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that in Babylon...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> DAOUD
    </p>
    <p>
      Hist!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, well...
    </p>
    <p>
      [MIRALDA glares, but calms herself and says nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exit DAOUD.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      What did Daoud say of Babylon?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, well, as you say, it had nothing to do with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      But I wish to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      [For a moment there is silence.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      John, John. Will you do a little thing for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Say you will do it, John. I should love to have one of my little wishes
      granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Kill Daoud, John. I want you to kill Daoud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He walks up and down in front of the two Nubians in silence. She plucks
      petulantly at a pillow. She suddenly calms herself. A light comes into her
      eyes. The Nubians go on fanning. JOHN goes on pacing.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      John, John, I have forgotten my foolish fancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I am glad of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not really wish you to kill Daoud.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN [same voice]
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm glad you don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I have only one fancy now, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Give a banquet, John. I want you to give a banquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      A banquet? Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there any harm in my fancy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Then if I may not be a queen, and if you will not kill Daoud for me, give
      a banquet, John. There is no harm in a banquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Very well. When do you want it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow, John. Bid all the great ones to it, all the illustrious ones in
      Al Shaldomir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      And bid Daoud come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Daoud? You asked me to kill him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not wish that any longer, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      You have queer moods, Miralda.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      May I not change my moods, John?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know. I don't understand them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      And ask Hafiz el Alcolahn, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Hafiz? Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know, John. It was just my fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Your fancy, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I will ask him. Have you any other fancy?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Not now, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Then go, Miralda.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Go?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I command it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Because you command it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I, the Shereef Al Shaldomir.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MIRALDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exit L.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walks to the door to see that she is really gone. He comes back to
      centre and stands with back to audience, pulling a cord quietly from his
      pocket and arranging it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moves half left and comes up behind BAZZALOL. Suddenly he slips the
      cord over BAZZALOL's head, and tightens it round his neck.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [BAZZALOL flops on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      THOOTHOOBABA goes on fanning.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Speak!
    </p>
    <p>
      [BAZZALOL is silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN tightens it more. THOOTHOOBABA goes on quietly fanning.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BAZZALOL
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would speak, raise your left hand. If you raise your left hand and
      do not speak you shall die.
    </p>
    <p>
      [BAZZALOL is silent. JOHN tightens more. BAZZALOL raises his great flabby
      left hand high. JOHN releases the cord. BAZZALOL blinks and moves his
      mouth.]

    <p>
      <br /> BAZZALOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Gracious Shereef, one visited the great lady and gave us gold, saying,
      "Speak not."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      When?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BAZZALOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Great master, one hour since.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN [a little viciously]
    </p>
    <p>
      Who?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BAZZALOL
    </p>
    <p>
      O heaven-sent, he was Hafiz el Alcolahn.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Give me the gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      [BAZZALOL gives it.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [To THOOTHOOBABA.] Give me the gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> THOOTHOOBABA
    </p>
    <p>
      Master, none gave me gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      [John touches his dagger, and looks like using it.
    </p>
    <p>
      THOOTHOOBABA gives it.]

    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Take back your gold. Be silent about this. You too.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He throws gold to BAZZALOL.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Gold does not make you silent, but there is a thing that does. What is
      that thing? Speak. What thing makes you silent?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BAZZALOL
    </p>
    <p>
      O, great master, it is death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Death, eh? And how will you die if you speak? You know how you will die?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BAZZALOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, heaven-sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell your comrade, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BAZZALOL
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall be eaten, great master.

    <p>
      You know by what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> BAZZALOL
    </p>
    <p>
      Small things, great master, small things. Oh-h-h-h. Oh-h-h.

      then takes a side pace to his left, standing against the wall, sword at
      the carry.

    <p>
      JOHN acknowledges salute by touching his forehead with the inner tips of
      his fingers.]

    <p>
      <br /> OFFICER-AT-ARMS
    </p>
    <p>
      Soldiers of Al Shaldomir; with the dance-step; march.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Enter R. some men in single file; uniform, pale green silks; swords at
      carry. They advance in single file, in a slightly serpentine way,
      deviating to their left a little out of the straight and returning to it,
      stepping neatly on the tips of their toes. Their march is fantastic and
      odd without being exactly funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The OFFICER-AT-ARMS falls in on their left flank and marches about level
      with the third or fourth man. When he reaches the centre he gives another
      word of command.]

      the fingers of the right hand, palm turned inwards.

      centre opposite JOHN. He exhibits his bowl.]

      little empty songs of the land of Nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      [He seats himself on the ground facing JOHN. He puts the bowl on the
      ground. He places a piece of silk, with queer designs on it over the bowl.
      He partly draws the silk away with his left hand and puts in his right. He
      brings out a young crocodile and holds it by the neck.]

    <p>

      walks away. As he goes he addresses his crocodile.]

      empty bowl. O thief, O appetite, you sought to evade the Shereef. The

      wings.]

      nice warm hell, Poolyana. The Shereef want no devil to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      [ZABNOOL before speaking returns to centre and pats air over ground where
      handkerchief lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then SHABEESH and ZABNOOL come together side by side and bow and smile
      together toward the SHEREEF. Gold is thrown to them, which ZABNOOL gathers
      and hands to SHABEESH, who gives a share back to ZABNOOL.]

      The Shereef is silent.

      of pink rose-leaves. They dance across, throwing down rose-leaves, leaving

      O, there is no need to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a need. [He rises.] People of Shaldomir, behold I know your
      plottings. I know the murmurings that you murmur against me. When I sleep
      in my inner chamber my ear is in the market, while I sit at meat I hear
      men whisper far hence and know their innermost thoughts. Hope not to
      overcome me by your plans nor by any manner of craftiness. My gods are
      gods of brass; none have escaped them. They cannot be overthrown. Of all
      men they favour my people. Their hands reach out to the uttermost ends of
      the earth. Take heed, for my gods are terrible. I am the Shereef; if any
      dare withstand me I will call on my gods and they shall crush him utterly.
      They shall grind him into the earth and trample him under, as though he
      had not been. The uttermost parts have feared the gods of the English.
      They reach out, they destroy, there is no escape from them. Be warned; for
      I do not permit any to stand against me. The laws that I have given you,
      you shall keep; there shall be no other laws. Whoso murmurs shall know my
      wrath and the wrath of my gods. Take heed, I speak not twice. I spoke once
      to Hussein. Hussein heard not; and Hussein is dead, his ears are closed
      for ever. Hear, O people.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      O Shereef, we murmur not against you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I know thoughts and hear whispers. I need not instruction, Hafiz.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAFIZ
    </p>
    <p>
      You exalt yourself over us as none did aforetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. And I will exalt myself. I have been Shereef hitherto, but now I will
      be king. Al Shaldomir is less than I desire. I have ruled too long over a
      little country. I will be the equal of Persia. I will be king; I proclaim
      it. The pass is mine; the mountains shall be mine also. And he that rules
      the mountains has mastery over all the plains beyond. If the men of the
      plains will not own it let them make ready; for my wrath will fall on them
      in the hour when they think me afar, on a night when they think I dream. I
      proclaim myself king over...

    <p>
      The penalty is death! Death is the punishment for what you do, Hafiz. You
      have dared while I spoke. Hafiz, your contempt is death. Go to Hussein. I,
      the king... say it.

    <p>
      Who lives here?

    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Cater; firm of Briggs, Cater, and Johnstone. What do you
      want?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Could I see Mr. Cater?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      He's out. Dining at the Mansion House.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      He is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Could I see Mrs. Cater?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      See Mrs. Cater? No, of course you couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She prepares to shut the door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss! Miss! Don't go, miss. Don't shut me out. If you knew what I'd
      suffered, if you knew what I'd suffered. Don't!
    </p>
    <p>
      LIZA [coming forward again]
    </p>
    <p>
      Suffered? Why? Ain't you got enough to eat?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I've had nothing all day.
    </p>

    <p>
      'Aven't you really now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No. And I get little enough at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA [kindly]
    </p>
    <p>
      You ought to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I... I can't. I can't bring myself... I've seen better times.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, you could work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN

      When you've what?
    </p>

      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Lost millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Millions?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I've lost everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ow did you lose it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Through being blind. But never mind, never mind. It's all gone now, and
      I'm hungry.

    <p>
      It's three years now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Couldn't get a regular job, like?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I suppose I might have. I suppose it's my fault, miss. But the heart
      was out of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear me, now.

      Miss.

      Yes?

      'Ave I?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. Would you do me a kind turn?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I dunno. I might, as yer so down on yer luck&mdash;I don't like to
      see a man like you are, I must say.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you let me come into the big house and speak to the missus a moment?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      She'd row me awful if I did. This house is very respectable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel, if you would, I feel, I feel my luck might change.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>

      <br /> SCENE 2

      The drawing-room at the Acacias.

    <p>
      A moment later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene is the same as in Act I, except that the sofa which was red is
      now green, and the photograph of Aunt Martha is replaced by that of a
      frowning old colonel. The ages of the four children in the photographs are
      the same, but their sexes have changed.

      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a gentleman to see you, mum, which is, properly speaking, not a
      gentleman at all, but 'e would come in, mum.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a gentleman! Good gracious, Liza, whatever do you mean?

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      LIZA [over shoulder]
    </p>
    <p>
      What does you want?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN [entering]
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a beggar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      O, really? You've no right to be coming into houses like this, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that, madam, I know that. Yet somehow I couldn't help myself. I've
      been begging for nearly three years now, and I've never done this before,
      yet somehow to-night I felt impelled to come to this house. I beg your
      pardon, humbly. Hunger drove me to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Hunger?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm very hungry, madam.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately Mr. Cater has not yet returned, or perhaps he might...
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      If you could give me a little to eat yourself, madam, a bit of stale
      bread, a crust, something that Mr. Cater would not want.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      It's very unusual, coming into a house like this and at such an hour&mdash;it's
      past eleven o'clock&mdash;and Mr. Cater not yet returned. Are you really
      hungry?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm very, very hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it's very unusual; but perhaps I might get you a little something.
    </p>
    <p>
      [She picks up an empty plate from the supper table.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Madam, I do not know how to thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      O, don't mention it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not met such kindness for three years. I... I'm starving. I've
      known better times.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY [kindly]
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll get you something. You've known better times, you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been intended for work in the City. And then, then I travelled, and&mdash;and
      I got very much taken with foreign countries, and I thought&mdash;but it
      all went to pieces. I lost everything. Here I am, starving.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY [as one might reply to the Mayoress who had lost her gloves]
    </p>
    <p>
      O, I'm so sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      [JOHN sighs deeply.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> MARY
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll get a nice bit of something to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand thanks to you, madam.

      LIZA [who has been standing near the door all the time]
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she's going to get you something.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven reward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Hungry as all that?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm on my beam ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheer up!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      That's all very well to say, living in a fine house, as you are, dry and
      warm and well-fed. But what have I to cheer up about?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Isn't there anything you could pop?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      What?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing you can take to the pawn-shop? I've tided over times I wanted a
      bit of cash that way sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      What could I pawn?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, well you've a watch-chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      A bit of old leather.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      But what about the watch?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I've no watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      O, funny having a watch-chain then.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      O, that's only for this; it's a bit of crystal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Funny bit of a thing. What's it for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it give to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't know. I don't know how I got it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't know how you got it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I can't remember at all. But I've a feeling about it, I can't explain
      what I feel; but I don't part with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't you? You might get something on it, likely and have a square meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I won't part with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel I won't. I never have.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel you won't?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I have that feeling very strongly. I've kept it always. Everything
      else is gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it long?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes. About ten years. I found I had it one morning in a train. It's
      odd that I can't remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      But wot d'yer keep it for?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Just for luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      [LIZA breaks into laughter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you are funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm on my beam ends. I don't know if that is funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      You're as down in your luck as ever you can be, and you go keeping a thing
      like that for luck. Why, you couldn't be funnier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what would you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, I 'ad a mascot once, all real gold; and I had rotten luck. Rotten
      luck I had. Rotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      And what did you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Took it back to the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      They was quite obliging about it. Gave me a wooden one instead, what was
      guaranteed. Luck changed very soon altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Could luck like mine change?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Course it could.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll be all right one of these days. Give me that mascot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I&mdash;I hardly like to. One has an awfully strong feeling with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      Give it to me. It's no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      I&mdash;I don't like to.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> LIZA
    </p>
    <p>
      You just give it to me. I tell you it's doing you no good. I know all
      about them mascots. Give it me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> JOHN
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I'll give it you. You're the first woman that's been kind to me
      since ... I'm on my beam ends.
    </p>

      There, there. I'm going to smash it, I am. These mascots! One's better

      The photographs of the four children change slightly. The Colonel gives
      place to Aunt Martha. The green sofa turns red. JOHN's clothes become neat
      and tidy. The hammer in LIZA's hand turns to a feather duster. Nothing
      else changes.]

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
